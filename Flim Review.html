            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>In a movie based off of the true story, it takes place in the year of 1996. It was early March when a group known as the Adventure Consultants took on to the voyage of climbing Everest. Now, this is a task that is easier said than done. It took the voyagers almost two months to summit. They began by meeting in a small town in Nepal, where they would begin the gameplan and get down to business.</p>

            <p>In the beginning treks up the mountain, the hikers run into some that tried to climb out but came down in severe need of oxygen. The hikers would continue on, and would head up for the next couple of months. They would go slowly up to each base, and spend about a week at each base. It was May 10, 1996 when they began their final climb around 12:00am. They would finally reach the summit at 2:00pm, and began to celebrate how they had climbed the tallest mountain on Earth. They then would exerience the craziest moments of their lives.</p>

            <p>Out of nowhere, little warning came of a huge snowstorm about to hit the mountain. The hikers began to head down, and the madness began. While most to the men had made it to the top, one of them (Doug) hadn't because of health issues, and was determined to make it to the top no matter how much the leader (Rob) tells him to quit. Rob ends up helping Doug to the top when the blizzard began to hit. When it hits, Rob and Doug take cover. Rob requests oxygen tanks from his crew when there are none. Doug, almost unconcious, unbuckles himself from the guide rope, and with dizziness and strong winds, he falls off the edge to his death. Meanwhile one of the men (Beck: From 1st image of review) is having problems with his vision, and stayed where he was about a few hundred feet from the summit. Another man (Scott) is suffering from hypothermia and stays with Beck. The other climbers go to get help, leaving Beck behind with a Japanese journeyer Yasuko. One of the climbers (Andy) goes up to find Rob, where Rob tells him Doug passed. Andy begins to feel hypoxia, where you believe you're overheating, so he began removing layers leading to his death. The crew back at camp urge Rob to move down the mountain, but he doesn't. They walkie-talkie to him his wife trying to get him to come down, reminding him of the baby they're having. The crew says they can't get the oxygen tanks up with the conditions, but he knows he can't make it down. Rob calls his wife and says in his last words to the baby, "Sleep well, my sweetheart. Please don't worry too much."</p>

            <p>Along with Rob's death, Scott dies of his hypothermia, and Yasuko also died to Beck's side. The crew back at camp tells Beck's wife that he never returned to camp, which she tells the kids. In a miracle, however, Beck, frostbitten, partially blind, and almost completely frozen, begins getting up and slowly venturing to camp. One of the climbers (Jon) spots him and radios the crew that he's alive, and they tell his wife. Together, they get a helicopter to bring Beck down. In Everest's conditions, however, a helicopter can suffer at that height, and so despite winds and extra weight, they get Beck safely. The crew and climbers return home. Beck returns home to hug Peach after losing both of his hands and nose. The movie ends with a shot of Rob's dead body frozen and covered in snow. All of the dead climbers' bodies still remain on the mountain.</p>
